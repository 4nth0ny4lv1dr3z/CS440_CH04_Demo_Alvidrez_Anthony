There are multiple reasons why I choose the GNU General Public License v3. Frist it provides basic permissions of the source code. Anyone can freely run the unmodified program as many times as they so choose without any restriction to access. The license also acknowledges the right of fair use. No covered work will also be restricted or prohibited to circumvention of technological measure. The work done by this code is protected as a perfectly liable solution to any problem the source code may solve. The works protected by the copyright may be charged any price or no price by the creators of the work. As the people in charge of the invention they have the right to either give it away for free or charge for their product. This copy right also states that you must keep proper citations of any modifications or changes to it. Such citations include the license itself, relevant date, and a notice stating that it was modified by the respective person. This license also has and will continue to have multiple versions. If for any reason that earlier or later versions are best suited to this project, then you have the right to change it to the appropriate version that is deemed necessary. This allows the creator access to choose how protected or free the license restricts the creation.
